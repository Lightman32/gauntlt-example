Feature: Ensure target is Not vulnerable to OpenSSL CCS injection

Background:
  Given "sslyze" is installed
  And the following environment variables:
    | name     | environment_variable_name      |
    | hostname | TEST_HOSTNAME |

Scenario: Ensure no SSLv2 and SSLv3 are disabled
  When I launch an "sslyze" attack with:
    """
    python <sslyze_path> --openssl_ccs <hostname>:443
    """
  Then the output should contain:
    """
   Not vulnerable to OpenSSL CCS injection
    """
